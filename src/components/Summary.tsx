        KD Horsemanship provides equine instruction from the beginner to
        intermediate rider, specializing in confidence building and natural
        horsemanship. A focus on dressage, jumping, and general horse care
        creates a strong foundation that can translate to all disciplines.

        Lessons begin with Western-style saddles and as riders gain confidence
        and progress becomes evident, the option of transitioning to
        English-style will become available.

        We have several well-trained lesson horses that are safe, personable,
        and just plain fun to ride. We have a rustic, cozy arena located in
        South Nampa that can handle a handful riders concurrently - we also
        offer mini-group lessons for siblings, camps, and more - so be sure to
        ask about availability and special events/classes when you book your
        times.
